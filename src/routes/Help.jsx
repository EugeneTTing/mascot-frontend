                <Collapsible title={"What is baseline risk?"}>
                    <p>
                        In MAsCoT, the baseline risk is the probability of a health outcome 
                        without the use of HRT. Existing prediction models, derived and 
                        validated by medical researchers, are used to predict baseline risks.

                <Collapsible title={"How is the risk with HRT determine?"}>
                    <p>
                        The effect of HRT use on a health outcome is most commonly 
                        described with relative risk or odds ratios in the literature. 
                        MAsCoT uses ratios found in recent literature to determine
                        the effect of HRT use.

                    <p>The baseline breast cancer risk prediction is provided 
                    by <a href="https://www.canrisk.org">CanRisk</a>, created

                    <h3>Risk Ratios</h3>
                    <p>The relative risk of breast cancer with HRT use is taken 
                    from a nested case control study by Vinogradova et al., 
                    assessing the risk of breast cancer from the use of 
                    different types of HRT, reporting adjusted odds ratios 
                    with reference to never users of HRT [4].</p>
